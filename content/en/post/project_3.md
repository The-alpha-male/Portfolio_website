In this project, I analyzed a comprehensive sales dataset to uncover trends and insights that inform key business decisions. By merging monthly sales data and cleaning it for accuracy, I was able to explore critical metrics such as total sales by month, best-selling cities, and peak buying times, transforming raw transactional data into actionable business intelligence.

- Data Analysis: I aggregated and cleaned the sales data across multiple months, removing null values and incorrect entries, and adding new columns for features like month, city, and total sales to facilitate a detailed analysis.

- Insight Discovery: I analyzed the data to identify the best month for sales, with December generating the highest revenue. I also pinpointed which cities sold the most products, with San Francisco leading the chart, and determined the optimal times for displaying advertisements, finding that sales peak around 11 AM and 7 PM.

- Product Insights: By exploring product combinations frequently bought together, I revealed that items like iPhones and Lightning Charging Cables were often purchased together, providing valuable information for cross-selling strategies. Additionally, I identified the most popular products, with USB-C Charging Cables leading in sales volume.

- Visualization: I created visualizations using Matplotlib to represent the sales trends, showing sales per month, city, and product, along with product prices. These visualizations provided a clear understanding of sales patterns and helped transform raw data into clear insights that can drive business decisions.


This project showcases my ability to work with large datasets and transform raw sales data into actionable business insights that can help drive strategic decisions. It demonstrates my skills in data preprocessing, including cleaning and merging data from multiple sources, as well as creating new features for analysis. I applied data exploration techniques to uncover key business insights, such as identifying the best-performing months, top-selling cities, and peak customer purchasing times. Additionally, my expertise in data visualization allowed me to present these insights clearly, enabling decision-makers to easily understand trends and patterns. This project highlights my proficiency in Python, pandas, and matplotlib for data analysis, all essential for making data-driven decisions in a business context.
